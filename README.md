I'm a co-founder of multiple businesses.

- [Casa Blanca Dusit](https://casablancabkk.com/), a coffee shop and hostel 
- [Goofy's Nail](https://www.instagram.com/goofynails.bkk/), a nail salon 
- [Gato Blanco](https://www.ragdollthailand.com/), a ragdoll cattery   (yes! seriously! I have 30+ cats!).
 
Coding still be a big part in my life. I code for my businesses that I partnered with.

Now I'm currently learning and exciting about functional programming and start using `fp-ts` and `io-ts`. Feel free to talk share anything about this with me!
