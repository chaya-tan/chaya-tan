![My talk at function programming meetup #1 in Bangkok, Thailand](https://imgur.com/tThOLuM.png "me")

I'm a co-founder of multiple businesses. From online shops, coffee shop, to a cattery (yes! seriously!). But, as I love coding from the day I can't even ship code by myself until now that I do everything by myself from coding to marketing. Coding still be a big part in my life. I code for my businesses that I partnered with.

Now I'm currently learning and exciting about functional programming and start using `fp-ts` and `io-ts`. Feel free to talk share anything about this with me!

Feel free to say hi to me at my Twitter @kreme_q!
